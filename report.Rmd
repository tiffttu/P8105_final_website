## About our project
We want to investigate contributing factors of the risk of post-operative complication using a dataset on colectomy surgeries performed 2014 - 2016 from multiple hospitals in Michigan. In addition, we created an application that enables interested users to use a subset of the data to create their own models, based on variables that they might find useful or that we may have not considered.    
           
Our full report can be found  [here](https://github.com/thecbp/P8105_final/blob/master/report.md). 
    
## Data and methods
To figure out which variables have an impact on post-surgery complication, we performed a regression analysis. We are using surgery site infection as our outcome of interest, as infection is the most common type of complication. 
       
The raw data contains 10868 rows and 992 columns. Each row corresponds to a single colectomy and an incredible amount of information, including a bevy of laboratory, disease, surgery and patient data.       
      
## Exploratory Analysis
We explored SSI association with insurance status, prior health conditions, and surgical time.
